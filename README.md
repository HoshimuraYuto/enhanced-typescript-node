# enhanced-typescript-node

A Dev Container configuration for quickly setting up a TypeScript development environment.

## Prerequisites

To get started, launch the Dev Container and run the following command:

```bash
pnpm i
```

## Running TypeScript Files

If you want to run TypeScript files without prioritizing execution speed, it is recommended to use [tsx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tsx). tsx command can run both CommonJS and ESModule, so this is the recommended method for this setup.

To run a TypeScript file, use the following command:

```bash
pnpm tsx index.ts
```
